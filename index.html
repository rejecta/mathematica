<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Rejecta Mathematica is an open access, online journal that publishes only papers that have been rejected from peer-reviewed journals (or conferences with comparable review standards) in the mathematical sciences.</p><p>At Rejecta Mathematica we believe that many previously rejected papers (even those rejected for legitimate reasons) can nonetheless have a very real value to the academic community. This value may take many forms:</p><ul><li><em><strong>"mapping the blind alleys of science"</strong><strong>:</strong> papers containing negative results can warn others against futile directions;&nbsp;</em></li><li><em><strong>"reinventing the wheel":</strong> papers accidentally rederiving a known result may contain new insight or ideas;&nbsp;</em></li><li><em><strong>"squaring the circle":</strong> papers discovered to contain a serious technical flaw may nevertheless contain information or ideas of interest;</em></li><li><em><strong>"applications of cold fusion":</strong> papers based on a controversial premise may contain ideas applicable in more traditional settings;<br /></em></li><li><em><strong>"misunderstood genius":</strong> other papers may simply have no natural home among existing journals.</em></li></ul><p>All research papers appearing in Rejecta Mathematica include an open letter from the authors discussing the paper''s original review process, disclosing any known flaws in the paper and stating the case for the paper''s value to the community.</p>

<h3>Selection and Scope</h3>
<p>Rejecta Mathematica publishes two types of papers: research articles and correspondences. The screening process for publishing research articles in Rejecta Mathematica includes no technical peer review (hence the slogan&nbsp;<em>Caveat Emptor</em>); rather, papers are selected on the basis of their potential interest to researchers in the mathematical sciences. It is expected that the authors will discuss any known flaws or rediscoveries with full and honest disclosure in their open letter. As an additional means of quality control, follow-up correspondences are strongly encouraged from the community at-large and will be considered for subsequent publication.<br /><br />The scope of Rejecta Mathematica is very broad, encompassing all disciplines relating to the mathematical sciences, including: pure and applied mathematics, statistics, engineering, and computer science.</p>

<h3>Open Access</h3>
<p>Rejecta Mathematica is an&nbsp;<em>open access</em> journal; all papers appearing in Rejecta Mathematica&nbsp; are immediately made freely available via this website for downloading, reading and distributing as long as the original authors and source are attributed.<br /><br />All works published in Rejecta Mathematica are distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial license that allows redistribution of the work while the authors retain copyright ownership.

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
